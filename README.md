# Heart-Disease-Mortality-Rate
The dataset is about, "U.S. Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County – 2016-2018".
In this dataset, I have shown how we can deal with the missing values in Python.
Four different methods are used to deal with missing values: 
(1) Deleting the columns with missing data,
(2) Deleting the rows with missing data,
(3) Filling the missing data with a value (mean) – Imputation, and
(4) Filling the missing data with KNNImputer.
Also, I have checked the accuracy of all those 4 methods using "sklearn.metrics" and "sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split" and I have picked the best one that suits this dataset.
